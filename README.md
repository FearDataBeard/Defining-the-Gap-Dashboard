# Defining the Gap Dashboard

An analytical Power BI dashboard designed to explore the gap between current organizational performance and strategic goals. This project focuses on identifying performance shortfalls across critical KPIs and highlighting priority areas for improvement and resource allocation.

The dashboard leverages dynamic visualizations, KPI indicators, and trend analysis to clearly define the "gap" between where an organization is and where it needs to be — supporting faster, more focused decision-making.
